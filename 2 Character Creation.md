## 2.0 Character Creation
**Step 1: Attribute Assignment**
* Baseline: All nine attributes begin at Rank 1.
* Rank Categories: Choose your character's Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary attribute categories (Physical, Social, Mental).
* Receive Points: You get a pool of points to add to your base ranks:
    * Primary Category: +5 points
    * Secondary Category: +4 points
    * Tertiary Category: +3 points
* Distribute Points: Assign these points to the three attributes within their respective categories. No attribute's final rank can exceed 5 at character creation.

**Step 2: Choose Talent Trees**
Select any three Talent Trees from the master list in Section 8.0. These three trees define your character's unique capabilities and class concept.

**Step 3: Background & Skills**
* Choose a Background: Select one Universal Background (Section 3.3). This provides four free skills at Rank 1 (Novice).
* Spend Skill Points: You receive 10 Skill Points. Spend these to increase skill ranks on a 1-for-1 basis. You can increase your background skills or acquire new ones. No skill can be raised higher than Rank 2 at character creation.
* Choose a cultural expertise: this provides you with knowledge, language skills, and a basic understanding of the culture's political and social situations. This expertise does not count towards the expertise from intellect.

**Step 4: Calculate Derived Statistics**
* Health Pools: Calculate Vitality, Poise, and Clarity (Section 6.2).
* Focus: Calculate your maximum Focus (Section 5.2).
* Defense Scores: Note your passive defense scores (Attribute + Defense Skill).
