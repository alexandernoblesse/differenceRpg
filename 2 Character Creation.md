## 2.0 Character Creation
**Step 1: Attribute Assignment**
* Baseline: All nine attributes begin at Rank 1.
* Rank Categories: Choose your character's Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary attribute categories (Physical, Social, Mental).
* Receive Points: You get a pool of points to add to your base ranks:
    * Primary Category: +5 points
    * Secondary Category: +4 points
    * Tertiary Category: +3 points
* Distribute Points: Assign these points to the three attributes within their respective categories. No attribute's final rank can exceed 5 at character creation.

**Step 2: Choose an Archetype**
Select one of the mundane Archetypes (Section 8.2). This choice determines your two Core Talent Trees.

**Step 3: Background & Skills**
* Choose a Background: Select one Universal Background (Section 3.3). This provides four free skills at Rank 1 (Novice).
* Spend Skill Points: You receive 10 Skill Points. Spend these to increase skill ranks on a 1-for-1 basis. You can increase your background skills or acquire new ones. No skill can be raised higher than Rank 3 at character creation.

**Step 4: Choose Elective Talent Tree**
Select your third Talent Tree from the list of Elective Trees (Section 8.3).
> ***Designer's Note:*** *The complete list of Elective Talent Trees is still pending development. For now, you may leave this selection blank or work with your Game Master to create a custom tree.*

**Step 5: Calculate Derived Statistics**
* Health Pools: Calculate Vitality, Poise, and Clarity (Section 6.2).
* Focus: Calculate your maximum Focus (Section 5.2).
* Defense Scores: Note your passive defense scores (Attribute + Defense Skill).

**Step 6: Finishing Touches**
Determine starting equipment, name, and other descriptive details.
