# Equipment List for Codaris

### An Introduction to Equipment in Codaris

The world of Codaris is in an "Era of Enlightenment", with a technological baseline analogous to the **Iron Age** being actively disrupted by the rise of **Arc-tech**. Therefore, this list is a blend of technologies. Common items like swords, bows, and basic tools are widely available and based on the Iron and Renaissance Ages. Advanced firearms, complex gadgets, and powered devices represent arc-tech and are drawn from the Renaissance and Steam Punk eras, re-flavored to fit the arcane-punk aesthetic of your world.

#### Economy: The Essence Dust Standard

The economy of Codaris is based on the **Essence Dust Standard**. For mechanical simplicity, this list uses a three-tiered system that reflects the lore's "Dust Economy" (for common folk) and "Scrip Economy" (for merchants and the wealthy).

* **Dust:** The base unit, representing a standardized gram-weight of Essence dust in a small packet. Used for minor, everyday purchases.
* **Packet:** A larger, stamped packet of dust. Used for standard goods and services. **1 Packet = 10 Dust.**
* **Scrip:** A unit representing a **Certified Treasury Note**, backed by dust in a secure vault. Used for major purchases and large transactions. **1 Scrip = 10 Packets.**

#### Factional Availability

Not all items are equally available everywhere.
* **The Kingdom of Eikkera** and its cities have the widest access to all types of goods.
* **The Artisan Republic of Kytos** produces the most advanced and experimental arc-tech.
* **The Cartel-State of Luvia** is the primary source of luxury goods and foreign imports.
* **The Granary States of Rova** are more traditional, with arc-tech being a rare sight.
* **The Ascendancy of Tero** focuses on high-quality, functional martial equipment over complex arc-tech.
* **The Nation of Basud** fields standardized military gear, often reverse-engineered from Eikkeran designs.
* **The City-State of Meldoria** may possess unique arc-tech based on fragmented knowledge from their fallen Aerian ancestors.
