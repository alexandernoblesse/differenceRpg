# Steam Punk Era Equipment

### Economy: Industrial Coinage
The standard gold, silver, and copper pieces are still in use, often minted by powerful industrial guilds or imperial nations. Banknotes and letters of credit are common for large sums.

* **Currency:** Gold Piece (gp), Silver Piece (sp), Copper Piece (cp)
* **Exchange Rate:** 10 Copper Pieces = 1 Silver Piece; 10 Silver Pieces = 1 Gold Piece.

## Weapons
Elegant dueling weapons and simple cudgels exist alongside the loud, brutally efficient firearms of the industrial age. *Note: Simpler weapons from previous eras are still in circulation, used by those who cannot afford or maintain modern firearms.*

> **New & Updated Traits:**
> * ***Powered (Coal):*** Requires a supply of burning coal and water. Takes one (?) action to start up. Lasts for 1 hour per 10 lbs of coal.
> * ***Repeating (X):*** Can be fired X times before it must be reloaded. Reloading takes two (??) Interact actions.
> * ***Loud:*** Firing this weapon is extremely loud, breaking stealth and deafening those nearby for a round unless they succeed on a DR 4 Vigor check.
> * ***Silent:*** This weapon makes very little noise; firing it does not automatically break stealth.
> * ***Automatic:*** As a (???) action, you can make a single attack roll and apply the result to all targets in a 15-foot cone. This consumes 10 shots.

> * ***Area Effect:*** Affects a 10-foot radius area from where it lands.
> * ***Spread:*** This weapon gains a Minor Edge (+1) when attacking targets within 10 feet, but suffers a Major Setback (-2) against targets beyond 30 feet.
