## 5.0 Core Resources
### 5.1 The Momentum System
> **Designer's Note:** The Momentum system below is Version 0.5. It is scheduled for a major overhaul to a "Flow State" mechanic where Momentum provides stacking passive buffs rather than being a spendable resource.

Momentum is a resource representing the flow of a scene. Max 5 per player, and max 5 for the GM.
* **Gaining:** A player gains 1 on a successful roll. The GM gains 1 on a player's failed roll.
* **Spending Player Momentum:**
    * **Push Your Luck (1-3):** Spend 1 Momentum to gain a **Minor Edge (+1 to x)** on a roll. You can spend up to 3 Momentum to gain up to an **Overwhelming Edge (+3 to x)**, respecting the standard cap.
    * **Declare a Critical (3):** If a declared roll succeeds, it's a best-possible result.
    * **Power Attack (2):** Roll weapon damage an additional time.
    * **Called Shot (2):** Bypass half armor or inflict a minor injury.
    * **Clutch Save (4):** Turn a failed roll into a simple success.

### 5.2 The Focus Resource
Focus is a personal pool of energy for powering special abilities, primarily Reactions and certain powerful Talents.
* **Calculation:** At character creation, choose either your Finesse or Resistance attributes.
    `Maximum Focus = 3 + Lowest Attribute Score from the chosen category`

### 5.3 The Essence Resource (Placeholder)
Essence is a personal pool of energy used to power magical Charms. This resource is only available to characters who select a magical Elective Talent Tree.

### 5.4 The Unified Recovery System
This system is built around a resource called **Recovery Dice**, which characters spend to restore their Health Pools and Focus.

#### Recovery Dice Pool
A character has a single pool of Recovery Dice, representing their general heroism and resilience.
* **Pool Size:** The number of Recovery Dice you have is equal to **`1 + your Tier of Play`**.
    * Tier 1 (Levels 1-5): **2 Recovery Dice**
    * Tier 2 (Levels 6-10): **3 Recovery Dice**
    * Tier 3 (Levels 11-15): **4 Recovery Dice**
    * Tier 4 (Levels 16-20): **5 Recovery Dice**
    * Tier 5 (Levels 21+): **6 Recovery Dice**

#### The Recovery Roll
When you spend one or more Recovery Dice, you roll them to generate **Recovery Points**.
* **The Roll:** For each Recovery Die you spend, you roll **`1d6 + your choice of Vigor, Composure, or Resolve`**.
* **The Choice:** You must choose which of your three Resistance Attributes to add to the roll, reflecting the narrative of your recovery.

#### Allocating Recovery Points
The total result of your Recovery Roll becomes a pool of Recovery Points. You can immediately spend these points:
* **1 Recovery Point** = Restore 1 point of **Vitality**.
* **1 Recovery Point** = Restore 1 point of **Poise**.
* **1 Recovery Point** = Restore 1 point of **Clarity**.
* **2 Recovery Points** = Restore 1 point of **Focus**.
