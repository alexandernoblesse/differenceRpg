## 3.0 Attributes & Skills
By default, Attributes and Skills have a maximum rank of 5, representing the peak of mortal potential. However, supernatural forces, advanced technology, or other extraordinary circumstances may allow a character to temporarily or permanently increase a score beyond this limit.

### 3.5 Expertise
Expertise represents a deep, focused understanding of a specific field, whether it's the proper use of a weapon or intimate knowledge of a particular subject. It is divided into two categories: **Equipment Expertise** and **Knowledge Expertise**.

A character can gain Expertise through the following methods:

* **Starting Expertise from Intellect:** A character begins play with a number of Expertise selections equal to their starting **Intellect** attribute score. These can be spent on either Equipment or Knowledge Expertise. If a character's Intellect attribute increases during play, they immediately gain one new Expertise selection.
* **Gaining Expertise through Talents:** Certain talents may grant Expertise in specific areas as part of their effect.
* **Earning Expertise through Downtime:** A character can gain new Expertise through dedicated training or study during downtime periods, subject to GM approval.

#### **Equipment Expertise**

This form of Expertise allows a character to unlock the full potential of their gear.

* **Function:** To benefit from an item's **Expert Traits**, a character must have the relevant Expertise for that specific item category (e.g., Longswords, Plate Armor, Shortbows). Standard Traits are always active, regardless of Expertise.

---

#### **Knowledge Expertise**

This form of Expertise represents specialized knowledge in a non-combat field, giving characters a distinct advantage when their unique skills are relevant.

* **Function:** Knowledge Expertise provides two key benefits:
    * **Automatic Success on Trivial Tasks:** When a character attempts an unopposed action that falls under one of their Knowledge Expertises, they automatically succeed without needing to roll if the task's Difficulty Rank (DR) is 2 or lower. These tasks are considered "Trivial" for someone with their specific training.
    * **Advantage on Difficult Tasks:** When making a check with a DR of 3 or higher, the character gains a **Minor Edge (+1)** for **each** of their Knowledge Expertises that is relevant to the task, as determined by the GM. These Edges stack, but the total benefit is subject to the standard cap of a maximum **Â±3 modifier** from Edges and Setbacks on a single roll.

* **Examples of Knowledge Expertise include:**
    * **Languages:** (e.g., Ancient Elvish, Dwarven Runes)
    * **Cultures:** (e.g., Orcish Traditions, Gnomish Engineering)
    * **Societal Niches:** (e.g., High Society, The Criminal Underworld, Noble Court Politics)
    * **Fields of Study:** (e.g., Alchemy, Astrology, Heraldry, Philosophy)
    * **Specific Lore:** (e.g., Dragon Lore, Pre-War History, Abyssal Demonology)
    * **Environment:** (e.g., Arctic Flora, Desert Fauna, Subterranean Navigation)
