## 7.0 Equipment, Wealth & Currency
This system is designed to be flexible. Before beginning a campaign, the Game Master and players should decide which of the following systems they wish to use: the abstract **Wealth System** or the concrete **Currency System**.

### 7.1 Wealth & Currency Systems
#### **System 1: The Wealth System (Abstract)**
This narrative-focused system is for groups who prefer less bookkeeping. A character's purchasing power is represented by their rank on the Wealth Ladder.

| Rank | Title | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | Destitute | Cannot afford daily essentials without assistance. |
| 1 | Struggling | Can afford basic food and lodging, but has no disposable income for gear. |
| 2 | Standard | Can afford all common goods (Availability 1-2) without tracking costs. |
| 3 | Prosperous | Can afford all uncommon and some rare goods (Availability 1-3) without tracking costs. |
| 4 | Wealthy | Can afford all rare goods (Availability 1-4). |
| 5 | Lordly | Can afford nearly any non-legendary item (Availability 1-5). |

**Acquiring Goods:** During downtime, a character can automatically acquire items with an Availability rank at or below their Wealth rank.

#### **System 2: The Currency System (Concrete)**
This traditional system is for groups who enjoy detailed resource management. All items have a specific cost in gold, silver, and copper pieces.

* **Standard Exchange Rate:** 10 Copper Pieces (cp) = 1 Silver Piece (sp); 10 Silver Pieces (sp) = 1 Gold Piece (gp).

#### **Bridging the Systems: Availability & Price**
An item's **Availability** rank provides a direct guideline for its market price.

| Availability | Description | Typical Price Range (gp) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Common | 1 sp - 10 gp |
| 2 | Uncommon | 10 gp - 100 gp |
| 3 | Rare | 100 gp - 1,000 gp |
| 4 | Very Rare | 1,000 gp - 10,000 gp |
| 5 | Legendary | 10,000+ gp (or not for sale) |

### 7.2 Equipment Rules
* **Social Impact of Armor:** Wearing noticeable armor in formal or civil settings can impose a **Minor Setback (-1)** on some social checks.
* **Expertise:** An item's standard **Traits** are always active. Its **Expert Traits** only provide their benefit if you have the relevant Expertise for that specific item category.

### 7.3 Trait Descriptions
#### **Standard Traits (Always Active)**
* **Cumbersome (Might X):** Requires a Might score of X to use without penalty. If your Might is lower, you suffer a **Minor Setback (-1)** on all actions involving this item.
* **Dangerous:** When you make an attack with this weapon and the roll fails, the GM can spend 1 Momentum to cause you to inflict damage equal to your Power attribute on an adjacent ally.
* **Fragile:** When you make an attack with this weapon, the GM can spend 1 Momentum to cause it to break after the attack is resolved.
* **Heavy:** Requires a Might of 3+. If your Might is lower, you suffer a Minor Setback (-1) on attack rolls with it.
* **Indirect:** This ranged weapon can arc shots over cover, ignoring Setbacks from cover and the `Brace` action.
* **Light:** Can be wielded in one's off-hand, allowing for two-weapon fighting.
* **Range (X/Y):** For ranged or thrown attacks. Attacks at long range (Y) suffer a Major Setback (-2).
* **Reach:** You can make melee attacks against targets up to 10 feet away.
* **Two-Handed:** Requires two hands to wield.
> **New Firearm Traits:**
> * ***Loud:*** Firing this weapon is extremely loud, breaking stealth and potentially deafening those nearby.
> * ***Misfire (X):*** On a d100 attack roll of X or lower, the weapon fails to fire and is jammed. It requires an Interact (►) action and a successful `DR 4` `Intellect + Crafting` check to clear.
> * ***Reload (X):*** This weapon requires X Interact (►) actions to reload after being fired.
> **Loading Trait (from previous era):**
> * ***Loading:*** This weapon requires a single Interact (►) action to reload after being fired.
> **New Industrial Traits:**
> * ***Powered (Fuel):*** This item requires a fuel source (like coal or aetheric cells) to function. It typically has a limited operational time before needing refueling.
> * ***Repeating (X):*** This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded. Reloading takes 2 Interact (►) actions.
> * ***Loud:*** Firing this weapon is extremely loud, breaking stealth and audible for up to a mile.
> * ***Silent:*** This weapon makes very little noise when fired, imposing a **Major Setback (-2)** on Perception checks to hear it.
> * ***Automatic:*** As a single Strike action, this weapon can attack a single target multiple times or multiple targets in a cone. This consumes a large amount of ammunition.
> * ***Reload (X):*** This weapon requires X Interact (►) actions to reload.
> * ***Area Effect:*** This attack affects a small area, hitting the target and potentially those adjacent to it.

#### **Expert Traits (Require Expertise)**
* **Agile:** You can use your Agility instead of Might for attack and damage rolls.
* **Breaching:** This weapon ignores 1 point of the target's Soak.
* **Brutal:** You may reroll any 1s on this weapon's damage dice.

* **Deadly:** When you hit with this weapon, you can spend 2 Player Momentum to automatically inflict a Minor Injury.
* **Defensive:** You can take the `Brace` action without being near cover.
* **Discreet:** Gain a Minor Edge (+1) on checks to conceal this weapon or prevent its confiscation.
* **Guard:** When you `Brace`, the Setback imposed on attackers increases to Major (-2).
* **Momentum:** If you moved at least 10 feet in a straight line towards your target, gain a Minor Edge (+1) on your attack roll.
* **Off-hand:** The Focus cost to make a `Strike` with this weapon in your off-hand is reduced from 2 to 1.
* **Presentable:** You do not suffer social Setbacks for wearing this armor in civil settings.
* **Quickdraw:** You can draw this weapon as part of the same action used to attack with it.
* **Versatile:** This one-handed weapon can be used with two hands. When used with two hands, increase its damage die by one step (d6->d8, d8->d10).
* **Vicious:** A critical hit deals one additional die of damage.
> *New Expert Trait: **Flexible**. This armor does not impose a Setback on Stealth checks.*
