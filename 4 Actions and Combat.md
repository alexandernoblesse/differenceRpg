## 4.0 Action & Combat

The combat systems detailed in this section—whether Physical, Social, or Mental—are designed for dramatic situations where the outcome is uncertain and meaningful to the story. For simpler or less critical tasks, a single action roll is often sufficient to resolve the outcome.

The GM should use the full combat system when the stakes are high and a blow-by-blow description of the conflict would add tension and excitement to the game. In trivial cases where the outcome is not as critical, a single roll can be used. For example, haggling with a shopkeeper for a minor discount should be resolved with a single `Bargain` action rather than a full social combat encounter. Similarly, a quick scuffle that is over in a moment can be handled with a single opposed `Strike` check, while a duel to the death would use the full combat rules.

### 4.1 Action Economy
* **Rounds and Turns:** Combat is organized into rounds. On your turn, choose to act fast or slow.
    * **Fast Turn:** Act before enemies, gain two actions (►►).
    * **Slow Turn:** Act after fast-moving enemies, gain three actions (►►►).
* **Actions (►):** Primary tasks. Cost can be one (►), two (►►), or three (►►►).
* **Free Actions (▷):** Minor tasks like speaking a short sentence.
* **Reactions ( ):** Actions taken in response to a trigger. One per round.

### 4.1.1 The Action Prefix Rule & Usage Limits
**The Core Rule: One Prefix Per Turn**
On your turn, you may only perform one action of any given prefix unless the action explicitly states otherwise. This applies to all actions on the Action Lists, as well as special actions granted by talents.

### 4.1.2 Tactical Movement Speed
A character's tactical movement speed, which is the distance they can travel with a single `Move` action (►), is determined by their Agility attribute rank.

| Agility Rank | Movement Speed per Action (►) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | 20 feet |
| 1–2 | 25 feet |
| 3–4 | 30 feet |
| 5–6 | 40 feet |
| 7–8 | 60 feet |
| 9+ | 80 feet |

This base speed can be modified by various effects, such as the `Fleet Footed` talent, which increases this value by 5 feet, or injuries like a `Twisted Ankle`, which reduces it by 10 feet.

## 4.2 Action Lists

## 4.3 Travel & Exploration
These rules govern long-distance travel, whether on foot, mounted, or by sea. They represent narrative-scale movement, where time is measured in hours or days rather than combat rounds.

### Overland Travel
The base speed for a group on foot is **20 miles per day**, assuming roughly 8 hours of travel. This speed is modified by the terrain the group is crossing and the pace they set.

#### Terrain Effects
| Terrain Type      | Speed Modifier | Example Distance |
|-------------------|:--------------:|------------------|
| Road / Plains     | Full Speed     | 20 miles/day     |
| Forest / Hills    | 3/4 Speed      | 15 miles/day     |
| Mountain / Swamp  | 1/2 Speed      | 10 miles/day     |

#### Travel Pace
* **Normal Pace:** The group travels for 8 hours, covering the standard distance determined by their speed and the terrain.
* **Fast Pace (Forced March):** The group travels for 12+ hours to cover more ground. They cover 1.5 times the normal distance for the day (e.g., 30 miles on a road). At the end of the day, each character must succeed on a `DR 5` Vigor resistance check or suffer fatigue (a **Minor Setback (-1)** to all Physical checks) until they take a Long Rest.
* **Slow Pace:** The group travels cautiously, covering half the normal distance (e.g., 10 miles on a road). This pace allows the group to use skills like `Stealth` to remain hidden or `Perception` to spot ambushes without penalty.

> **Note on Movement Speed:** These rules are for narrative overland travel and do not replace the tactical movement speeds used in combat. Talents that increase tactical speed, like the Scoundrel's `Fleet Footed`, do not directly add to these daily totals, though a GM might grant a small circumstantial bonus (e.g., +1 or +2 miles per day) to a party with exceptionally fast members.

### Naval Travel
Travel by sea is dependent on the vessel and the prevailing conditions. Each vessel's base speed is listed in its equipment profile.

* **Wind Conditions:** At the start of each day of sea travel, the GM determines the winds.
    * **Favorable Winds:** The wind is strong and blows in the direction of travel. A sailing vessel's speed is doubled for the day.
    * **Unfavorable Winds:** The wind blows against the direction of travel. A sailing vessel's speed is halved. Rowed vessels are unaffected if they rely on oars.
    * **Becalmed / No Wind:** There is no wind to fill the sails. Sailing vessels that lack oars cannot move.
    * **Storms:** Severe weather makes travel impossible and may require skill checks from the crew to navigate the danger and avoid damage to the ship.

### Using Skills in Travel
Characters can use their skills to overcome the challenges of a long journey. For example, a character might make an `Intellect + Survival` check to navigate a faster path through the wilderness, potentially negating the speed penalty from difficult terrain for one day on a successful roll.
