## 8.0 Archetypes & Talents
### 8.1 The Three-Tree System
Each character has three Talent Trees: two Core Trees from their Archetype and one Elective Tree of their choice. Talents interact with the Edges & Setbacks system, often granting or enhancing them.

* ***Example Talent Update:*** A talent like *"Tower Shield Master"* would be updated to read: *"Attacks against you while Bracing suffer a Major Setback (−2 to x) instead of the usual −1."*
* ***Example Reaction Update:*** Reactions like *"Support Ally"* would be updated to *"grant a Minor Edge (+1 to x)"* on the triggering ally's roll, while a reaction like *"Rebuff"* would *"impose a Minor Setback (−1 to x)"* on a foe's roll.

### 8.2 Mundane Archetypes
* **Physical:** Vanguard, Warrior, Scoundrel
* **Social:** Commander, Envoy, Schemer
* **Mental:** Scholar, Tactician, Investigator

### 8.3 Elective Talent Trees
These are specialized disciplines any character can choose (e.g., Alchemy, Marksman, Medicine). Magical trees that grant Charms are also chosen from this list.

### 8.4 Archetype: Investigator

#### Core Talent Tree 1: Method of Deduction
This tree focuses on the Investigator's uncanny ability to gather and process information, turning subtle clues into powerful advantages.

##### Tier 1 (Levels 1-5)

- **A Keen Eye** *(Permanent)*  
  **Prerequisites:** None  
  **Effect:** Your mind is constantly sifting through details. You gain a permanent +1 bonus to the calculated Difference (x) on all checks involving the Perception or Investigation skills.

- **Deductive Leap** *(►►)*  
  **Prerequisites:** A Keen Eye  
  **Cost:** 1 Focus  
  **Effect:** You focus on a single target, analyzing their tells, habits, and speech patterns. Make an opposed Intellect + Investigation check against your target's Wits + Evade defense. On a success, you have "Uncovered" them. For the rest of the scene, you and your allies gain a +2 bonus to the Difference (x) on all Insight, Persuasion, and Intimidation checks made against that target. You can only have one target Uncovered at a time.

##### Tier 2 (Levels 6-10)

- **Connect the Dots** *(Permanent)*  
  **Prerequisites:** Deductive Leap  
  **Effect:** Each piece of information fuels your momentum. Whenever you succeed on an Investigation or Insight check, the party gains 1 Momentum. This can only trigger once per round.

- **Rapid Assessment** *(►)*  
  **Prerequisites:** Deductive Leap  
  **Cost:** 2 Focus  
  **Effect:** You take a moment to rapidly process your surroundings. You immediately gain two free actions (▷▷). These free actions can only be used to perform checks using Mental Skills (Investigation, Lore, Medicine, Perception, Insight, Survival).

##### Tier 3 (Levels 11-15)

- **I See the Truth** *(Reactive )*  
  **Prerequisites:** Connect the Dots  
  **Cost:** 1 Focus  
  **Effect:** When a character you can see and hear speaks, you may use your reaction to make an opposed Wits + Insight check against their Composure + Deflect defense. On a success, you instantly know if they are consciously telling a lie. This does not reveal the truth, only the presence of falsehood.

- **Pattern Recognition** *(Supplemental)*  
  **Prerequisites:** Rapid Assessment  
  **Cost:** 2 Focus  
  **Effect:** After a character has acted twice in a scene, you can declare you are analyzing their pattern. Before they take their next turn, you can spend the cost to make an Intellect + Investigation check (DR 6). On a success, you correctly predict their general intent (e.g., "attack the most wounded ally," "create a distraction," "attempt to flee"), and you gain a +3 bonus to the Difference (x) on any one check you make in reaction to their turn.

##### Tier 4 (Levels 16-20)

- **Forensic Acumen** *(►►)*  
  **Prerequisites:** I See the Truth  
  **Cost:** 2 Momentum  
  **Effect:** You apply your deductive skills to an inanimate object or a discrete area (e.g., a corpse, a set of tracks, a broken lock). You learn one crucial, non-obvious piece of information about it, determined by the GM. (e.g., the victim was poisoned before being stabbed, these tracks were made by someone carrying a heavy load, this lock was picked by an amateur).

- **Everything is a Clue** *(►►►)*  
  **Prerequisites:** Pattern Recognition  
  **Cost:** 3 Focus  
  **Effect:** You take in the totality of the current scene. For the rest of the scene, once per round, you may add your Intellect attribute score to any single check made by you or an ally you can communicate with. You must declare this before the roll is made.

##### Tier 5 (Levels 21+)

- **Incontrovertible Thesis** *(►►►)*  
  **Prerequisites:** Forensic Acumen OR Everything is a Clue  
  **Cost:** 5 Focus, 3 Momentum  
  **Effect:** Once per adventure, you can present a perfectly articulated and evidenced conclusion that reshapes the narrative. You state your grand conclusion about the current mystery. You do not need to make a roll; you simply succeed at the highest possible level. This could be convincing a council of the true villain's identity, proving the innocence of a wrongly accused person beyond a shadow of a doubt, or deciphering the final clue of a legendary puzzle. The GM has the final say on the scope, but the effect should be dramatic and conclusive.

- **Leave No Stone Unturned** *(Permanent)*  
  **Prerequisites:** Steely Resolve  
  **Effect:** Your persistence is legendary. During a long-term investigation (downtime), you may spend 3 Momentum to declare that you are exhaustively reviewing the case. You can ask the GM one direct question about a clue you may have missed or a connection you haven't made, which they must answer truthfully.

##### Tier 5 (Levels 21+)

- **Case Closed** *(►►►)*  
  **Prerequisites:** The Final Accusation OR Leave No Stone Unturned  
  **Cost:** 5 Focus, 5 Momentum  
  **Effect:** Once per adventure, you can force a final confrontation with a single non-mythic antagonist that you have thoroughly investigated (e.g., they are Uncovered and you have Exposed their flaw). You make a final, opposed Resolve + Leadership check against their Resolve + Fortify defense. If you succeed, their will is broken. They do not die, but they are utterly defeated as a narrative force—they confess, surrender their power, go into exile, or are otherwise removed as a threat for the remainder of the story, subject to GM approval.
