## 9.0 Progression & Tiers of Play
### 9.1 Gaining Levels
Characters advance through XP or Milestones.
* XP to Next Level = `10 x Current Tier Number`

### 9.2 Tiers of Play
* **Tier 1:** Local Heroes (Levels 1–5)
* **Tier 2:** Proven Professionals (Levels 6–10)
* **Tier 3:** Regional Figures (Levels 11–15)
* **Tier 4:** National Leaders (Levels 16–20)
* **Tier 5:** World Shapers (Levels 21+)

### 9.3 Skill Rank Cap by Tier
The maximum rank a character can have in any skill is now limited by their current Tier of Play. The cap is calculated as follows:

`Maximum Skill Rank = Current Tier of Play + 1`

This tiered limit governs how Skill Points can be spent upon leveling up.

| Tier of Play | Level Range | Maximum Skill Rank | Skill Title |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | Levels 1–5 | **Rank 2** | Competent |
| **Tier 2** | Levels 6–10 | **Rank 3** | Expert |
| **Tier 3** | Levels 11–15 | **Rank 4** | Master |
| **Tier 4** | Levels 16–20 | **Rank 5** | Grandmaster |
| **Tier 5** | Levels 21+ | **Rank 5** | Grandmaster |

### 9.4 Level-Up Progression

## 10.0 GM Toolkit
This section provides tools and guidelines for the Game Master to create adversaries, balance encounters, and manage the game.

### 10.1 Quick NPC Generation
These guidelines are designed to help the GM quickly create stats for non-player characters (NPCs) without extensive setup.

#### **Humanoid NPCs**
* **Attributes:** An attribute rank of 2 is considered average for a typical person. For most standard human NPCs like guards, merchants, or commoners, you can assume their attributes are Rank 2. An NPC who is particularly adept in one area might have a Rank 3 in the relevant attribute, while one who is deficient would have a Rank 1.

* **Skills:** An NPC's skill ranks are determined by their profession and experience level.
    * **Primary Skills:** For skills directly related to their job, assign a rank based on their proficiency. A Novice would have Rank 1, a Competent professional would have Rank 2, and a seasoned Expert would have Rank 3.
    * **Tangential Skills:** For skills that are related but not core to their profession, assign a Rank of 1 or 2. For instance, a blacksmith (Primary Skill: Crafting) might have Athletics at Rank 1 as a tangential skill.
    * **Unrelated Skills:** For all other skills, the NPC is likely Untrained (Rank 0).

#### **Animal NPCs**
* **Vigor:** For animals and non-sentient creatures, their Vigor attribute is often directly related to their physical size. Bigger animals can typically endure more punishment and thus have a higher Vigor score. A small animal might have a Vigor of 1, while a large, durable beast could have a Vigor of 4 or 5.

## 11.0 Systems Pending Development
* **Momentum System Overhaul:** Redesigning Momentum to be a "Flow State" mechanic.
* **Full Talent Tree List:** Creating the complete lists of talents that allow characters to gain Expertise and use special Techniques.
* **GM Toolkit:** Guidelines for creating adversaries, balancing encounters, and managing the game.
