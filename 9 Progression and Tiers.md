#### 9.3 Level-Up Benefits
When your character gains a level, they receive new benefits to reflect their growing experience. The maximum rank for any attribute or skill that can be achieved through leveling is 5. Surpassing this limit requires extraordinary means, such as powerful magic or technology, as determined by the Game Master.

* **Talent Point:** At every **even-numbered level** (2, 4, 6, etc.), you gain one Talent Point. After level 20, no more talent points are gained unless the GM approves it. You can spend this immediately on any talent for which you meet the prerequisites within your three chosen Talent Trees.
* **Skill Point:** At levels **2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20**, you gain one Skill Point. After level 20, no more skill points are gained unless the GM approves it. You can spend this to increase the rank of any skill by one, not to exceed the maximum rank of 5 (Grandmaster).
* **Attribute Point:** At every **fourth level** (4, 8, 12, 16, and 20), you gain one Attribute Point. After level 20, no more attributes points are gained unless the GM approves it. You can increase any of the nine attributes by one, not to exceed the maximum rank of 5.
    * **Capped Attribute Option:** If you are awarded an Attribute Point but all of your attributes are already at Rank 5, you may instead gain one new **Expertise** selection.
